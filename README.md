# Binary Classification of Iris Species Using Logistic Regression

This project focuses on building a binary classifier using logistic regression to distinguish Iris-setosa from other iris species (Iris-versicolor and Iris-virginica)

## Dataset
- The iris dataset csv file is has been uploaded in this reposatory.

For this project, the dataset was modified into a binary classification task:
- `0` — Iris-setosa
- `1` — Not-Iris-setosa (i.e., versicolor or virginica)

## Objectives

- Read and preview the Iris dataset.
- Check the structure of the data, inconsistsncies and data type
- Identify the dependent and independent variables
- Encode the target variable for binary classification.
- Split the dataset into training and test sets.
- Train a logistic regression model using scikit-learn.
- Predict and evaluate using a confusion matrix.
- Calculate accuracy, precision, and recall manually.
- Analyze and comment on calculations and model performance.

## Requirements 

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas
- NumPy
- scikit-learn
